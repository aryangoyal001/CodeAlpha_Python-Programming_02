## Task 2 - Stock Portfolio Tracker
- This is my **Second Task** for the **CodeAlpha Python-Programming Internship**.
  -  This stock portfolio tracker is a Python application designed to help users manage and monitor their investment portfolios.
---

## Project Description

- I created a **Stock Portfolio Tracker** using my **PYTHON SKILLS** 
- Creating a Stock Portfolio Tracker in Python is a great project for managing and analyzing investments.
- The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a Python-based console application that allows users to manage and calculate their investments in various Indian stock indices and companies using manually defined stock prices.
- The application helps track total investment value based on user input and can optionally save results to .txt or .csv files.
---

##  Goals
- Allow users to enter stock names and quantities.
- Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices.
- Calculate and display the total investment value.
- Provide suggestions for mistyped stock symbols.
- Display the percentage share of each stock in the portfolio.
- Optionally save the portfolio to a text or CSV file.

---
##  Key Features
- User Input: Enter stock names (e.g., SENSEX, NIFTY50, RELIANCE, BAL) and quantities.
- Hardcoded Price Dictionary: Uses fixed prices for predefined stocks.
- Input Suggestions: Uses Python's difflib to suggest closest matching stock symbols if the input is invalid.
- Portfolio Summary: Shows detailed breakdown including percentage of each stock in the total investment.
- File Export: Allows exporting portfolio details to .txt or .csv.
- Simple and Lightweight: No third-party libraries required.

---
 ## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Standard libraries:
    - difflib – for stock name suggestions
    - os (optional) – for file handling (open saved file)
    - datetime (optional) – for time-stamping saved files

---
## How It Works (Flow)
- User is shown available stock options.
- Enters a stock symbol and the quantity owned.
- Tracker calculates the total value for each stock.
- Once done, the full portfolio summary with percentages is displayed.
- User is asked if they want to save the result to a file.
